//! Metric name registry (Spine E-2) — the single vocabulary the samplers, the
//! GUI, the session log and the offline analyzer all reference, so a metric
//! written under one name is read under the same name everywhere (no drift).
//!
//! Naming scheme: `<subsystem>.<noun>.<unit>` in dotted lower_snake, with
//! subsystem prefixes `runtime` | `net` | `loading` | `offload` | `record`.
//! The unit
//! suffix hints the value type by convention (`.ms`/`.secs`/`.bytes`/`.pct`
//! are gauges or histograms; `.count` is a counter), but the authoritative
//! shape is the [`MetricKind`] recorded alongside each name in [`ALL`].
//!
//! Each `&'static str` doubles as the `HashMap` key in
//! [`MetricsRegistry`](crate::diagnostics::MetricsRegistry), so lookups are
//! pointer-cheap and a mistyped name is a missing const (compile error) rather
//! than a silently orphaned bucket.
