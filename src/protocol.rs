//! Wire protocol for `OverlandsMessage`. The message enum is Serde-tagged
//! and rides the `bevy_symbios_multiuser` data channels; each variant's
//! docstring records which channel it is expected to travel over.
//!
//! Avatar records are **not** broadcast inline — Identity carries just the
//! peer's DID/handle, and the receiver fetches the signed `AvatarRecord`
//! from the owner's PDS directly. The lightweight `AvatarStateUpdate`
//! variant nudges peers to re-fetch after a live edit.
